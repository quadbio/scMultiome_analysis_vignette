# Tutorial of single-cell RNA-ATAC multiomic sequencing data analysis in R
This tutorial is about analyzing single-cell RNA-ATAC multiomic data. It includes three sections:
1. The mono-modal analysis focusing on only the RNA or the ATAC data;
2. The bi-modal integrative analysis using both modalities;
3. Gene regulatory network reconstruction using Pando.

The example data used in this tutorial is a part of the paper "[Fate and state transitions during human blood vessel organoid development](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.23.485329v1)".

Please contact Dr. Zhisong He (zhisong.he(at)bsse.ethz.ch) or Prof. Barbara Treutlein (barbara.treutlein(at)bsse.ethz.ch) if there is any question.
